        "\n",
        "In data mining or ML, “imbalanced classes” is a familiar problem particularly occurring in classification when we have datasets with an unequal ratio of data points in each class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Training of model becomes much trickier as typical accuracy is no longer a reliable metric for measuring the performance of the model. Now if the number of data points in minority class is much less, then it may end up being completely ignored during training.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Problems with the imbalanced data**\n",
        "\n",
        "Unbalanced class distributions present a barrier, even though many machine learning algorithms work best when there are nearly equal numbers of samples in each class. A model may appear to have high accuracy in these situations if it primarily predicts the majority class. In such cases, having high accuracy becomes deceptive. Sadly, the minority class—which is frequently the main focus of model creation—is ignored by this strategy. In the event that 99% of the data pertains to the majority class, for example, simple classification models such as logistic regression or decision trees may find it difficult to recognize and precisely forecast occurrences from the minority class."

This can be accomplished by either over-sampling, which adds more examples from the minority class, or under-sampling, which removes samples from the majority class. One method for reducing the difficulties caused by severely skewed datasets is resampling, which balances the class distribution.\n",
